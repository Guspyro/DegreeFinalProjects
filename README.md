# Degree Final Projects
Final Projects for Software Engineering and Videogame Development degrees.

This repository includes:
- Unity project which contains both the procedural map generator and the frontend for managing your account and your uploaded files.
- The code of the API used in the backend (2 AWS Lambda functions).
- The report submitted and the slides used on the presentation. This includes, in Spanish, all planification, design and development of both projects.
- A build of the project as a release.

    *Note: the backend services are not available on the build, since the Amazon Web Services account used was removed after the project submission.*
